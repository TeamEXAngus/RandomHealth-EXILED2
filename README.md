# RandomHealth-EXILED2
A plugin for SCP: Secret Lab which allows server owners to configure minimum and maximum values for a role's max HP, rather than having it be a fixed amount. An example config can be found [here](https://github.com/TeamEXAngus/RandomHealth-EXILED2/blob/master/example-config.yml).
